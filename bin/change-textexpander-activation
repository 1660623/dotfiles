require 'plist'
require 'trollop'

Trollop.options do
  banner <<-EOS
Accepts a TextExpander export file with a collection of snippets, a regular
expression to parse the snippets and a new activation sequence to use for the
snippets. It then outputs the updated TextExpander export file for later
import back into TextExpander.

Usage: #{File.basename($PROGRAM_NAME)} <path> <regex> <new_activation_sequence>

Arguments:

path - Path to a PList file containing one or more TextExpander snippets
regex - Regular expression to match current snippets with. The first capture
        is the part of the expression that is to be kept.
new_activation_sequence - Key sequence to use as the new activation sequence.
                          It will be prepended onto the contents of the
                          capture from the `regex` parameter.

Options:
