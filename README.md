# Lee's Dotfile Customizations

These are my myriad [dotfiles](http://dotfiles.github.io/). It has grown, morphed, shifted and developed since I discovered the [Thoughtbot dotfiles project](https://github.com/thoughtbot/dotfiles) and based this off of that. Hats off to the Thoughtbot folks for making basing my stuff off of theirs so easy! :laughing:

## Installation

1. Install [strap](https://github.com/mikemcquaid/strap)

1. Create a symlink for the `packages` directory so Atom stylesheet stuff works correctly

    ```bash
    $ ln -s ~/.atom/packages ~/.dotfiles/atom/packages
    ```
